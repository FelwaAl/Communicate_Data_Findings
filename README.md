# Communicate Data Findings

This repository contains a project focused on the clear and effective communication of data analysis findings using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and data visualization libraries.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to demonstrate and practice best practices in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the communication of insights through polished visualizations and narrative explanations. The project covers all phases from initial data wrangling to multivariate exploration and explanatory storytelling.

## Repository Contents

- `Communicate_Data_Findings.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all analysis steps, visualizations, and explanations.
- `Communicate_Data_Findings.html`: Exported HTML version of the main notebook for easy viewing without running code.
- `Communicate_Data_Findings_Explanatory.ipynb`: A notebook focusing on the explanatory phase, with visualizations designed for effective storytelling.
- `Communicate_Data_Findings_Explanatory.html`: Exported HTML version of the explanatory notebook.
- (Dataset and other supporting files, if included.)

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Data loaded, cleaned, and prepared for analysis using pandas and numpy.
- **Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate Analysis:** Exploratory visualizations including histograms, scatter plots, boxplots, facet grids, and more.
- **Explanatory Visualizations:** Visuals designed to clearly communicate key insights to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- **Code Quality:** Well-documented, readable code with comments and meaningful variable names. Functions are used where code repetition is needed.
- **Narrative:** Written summaries and interpretations for each analysis phase and visualization.
